# COVID19 Agent-Based Modeling

This repository uses the [`epiworld`](https://github.com/UofUEpi/epiworld) C++
library for simulating COVID-19 disease. The modeling is done at two different
levels: Salt Lake City, in Utah (US), and the entire United States.

Resulting reports

- Salt Lake City (model 0) ([link](model-saltlake/model-00/)).
