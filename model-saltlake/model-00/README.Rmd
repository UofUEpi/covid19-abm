# Model 0 for Salt Lake City

This simulation model features the following:

1. Five different states: Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, and Removed.

2. The population size is 10,000 individuals, all connected at the household level,
 and between households.

3. A baseline probability of infection is .9.

4. Daily recovery rate for an infected agent is `1/7`.

5. Daily death rate for an infected agent is .01.

6. There is one virus that starts with 5% of the population exposed.

7. The simulation lasts 100 days, and replicated a thousand times.

The implementation details can be found in [00main.cpp](00main.cpp). After
compilation, the execution of the program results in the following output:

```{bash}
./00main.o
```

Statuses' trajectories have the following distribution:

```{r posterior-dist, dev="svg", echo = FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
dat <- lapply(list.files("results", full.names = TRUE), fread)
dat <- Map(\(d, i) d[, r := i], d = dat, i = seq_along(dat) - 1) |>
    rbindlist()

summ <- dat[, .(
    `2.5%`  = quantile(counts, probs = .025),
    Mean    = mean(counts),
    `97.5%` = quantile(counts, prob = .975)
    ), by = .(date, status)][
        date %inrange% c(1,30)][
            status != "Susceptible"]

setorder(summ, status, date)

ggplot(summ, aes(x = date, colour = status)) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(
        y = Mean, ymin = `2.5%`, ymax = `97.5%`,
        colour = status
        ), alpha = .3) +
    geom_line(aes(y = Mean)) +
    labs(
        x = "Day", y = "Counts",
        title = "Distribution of cases after 1,000 replicates"
        ) 
```
