# Model 0 for Salt Lake City

This simulation model features the following:

1.  Five different states: Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered,
    and Removed.

2.  The population size is 10,000 individuals, all connected at the
    household level, and between households.

3.  A baseline probability of infection is .9.

4.  Daily recovery rate for an infected agent is `1/7`.

5.  Daily death rate for an infected agent is .01.

6.  There is one virus that starts with 5% of the population exposed.

7.  The simulation lasts 100 days, and replicated a thousand times.

The implementation details can be found in [00main.cpp](00main.cpp).
After compilation, the execution of the program results in the following
output:

``` bash
./00main.o
```
